# Environmental Intelligence Suite Alert Demo

This tutorial demonstrates how IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS) weather alerts can be published to a message queue defined using the SAP Event Mesh service on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). By publishing these alerts to SAP Event Mesh, applications running on SAP BTP can easily consume them.

We use the following components:
- **IBM EIS.** The system is configured to generate alerts.
- **SAP Open Connectors.** An API connector serves as a proxy between EIS and SAP Event Mesh, allowing us to format the HTTP message as needed by SAP Event Mesh.
- **SAP Event Mesh.** Alert messages generated by EIS are added to a message queue, that an application can subscribe to.
