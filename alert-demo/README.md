# Environmental Intelligence Suite Alert Demo

This tutorial demonstrates how IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS) weather alerts can be published to a message queue defined using the SAP Event Mesh service on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). By publishing these alerts to SAP Event Mesh, applications running on SAP BTP can easily consume them.

## Reference Architecture

We use the following components:
- **IBM EIS.** The system is configured to generate alerts.
- **SAP Open Connectors.** An API connector serves as a proxy between EIS and SAP Event Mesh, allowing us to format the HTTP message as needed by SAP Event Mesh.
- **SAP Event Mesh.** Alert messages generated by EIS are added to a message queue, that an application can subscribe to.

## Prerequisites

In order to perform this tutorial you will need to have access to IBM EIS.

- IBMers can request EIS access [here](https://eistrialrequest.ideas.aha.io/portal_session/new).
- Non-IBMers can request a [30-day free trial](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51911&_gl=1*9cen1r*_ga*NzczNTIyMDM3LjE2ODkxNzIwNjE.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY4OTUzODI1My4yMi4xLjE2ODk1Mzg2MjEuMC4wLjA).

In addition, you will need access to the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). You will need an [enterprise account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enterprise-accounts) in order to deploy SAP Event Mesh.


## Tutorial outline

This tutorial has three parts that should be performed in order.

- **Part 1:** Deploy SAP Event Mesh queue.
- **Part 2:** Deploy API connector SAP Integration Suite.
- **Part 3:** Configure EIS alerting.
